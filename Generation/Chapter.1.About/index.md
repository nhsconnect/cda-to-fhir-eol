###Overview: CDA on FHIR England - End of Life DMS#

**Background**

The CDA on FHIR England (COFE) End of Life (EOL) Care Document project aims to provide a viable alternative to HL7 v3 CDA for the transfer of end of life records between GP Systems/ Electronic Palliative Care Co-ordination Systems (known as EPaCCS) and other healthcare organizations within NHS and social care settings, using the HL7 FHIR standard.

**Supported Communications**

The CDA on FHIR England - End of Life Domain Message  Specification supports the following care communications:

- End of Life (EOL) Care Document - A FHIR Document containing information supporting transfer of end of life records between GP Systems/ Electronic Palliative Care Co-ordination Systems (known as EPaCCS) and other healthcare organizations within NHS and social care settings.
<!--
**Supported Scenarios (see Ref #1 below)**

The Transfer Of Care Domain Message eDischarge Specification supports the following scenarios :

- Transfer of Care scenarios described in the "Standards for the clinical structure and content of patient records" document published by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC) (July 2013). This phase of the Transfer of Care DMS will cover inpatient 
discharge summaries which incorporate AoMRC headings as defined by the document.

- Transfer of Care scenarios described in the "Documentation standards for discharge summary to GP for mental health adult patients" (Final Report August 2016).

**Ref #1:**

"Standards for the clinical structure and content of patient records" describes the standards for the structure and content of patient records, covering hospital referral letters, inpatient clerking, handover communications, discharge summaries and outpatient letters. These standards were signed off as fit for purpose by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, and have been recognised by the independent Professional Record Standards Body (PRSB), who were established to oversee the development and maintenance of health and social care records. This work led to requirements for this specification which was endorsed by the National Information Board (NIB).
